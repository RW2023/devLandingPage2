Dev Landing Page

This is a personal project where I am creating a landing page for myself. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills and projects to potential employers and clients.
Features

I am currently working on implementing the following features on my landing page:

    A navigation bar that takes you to different parts of the page
    An about section where visitors can learn a little about me
    A projects section where I showcase some of my work
    A skills section where I list my skills

I'm always open to new ideas, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know!
